# Flat Earth Challenge

This is the repository for the frontend part of the Flat Earth Challenge. 
As the app is still in the final stages of development, the full project is not yet deployed.

However, a frontend only version of the app is available on [Github Pages](https://lucaignatescu.github.io/FlatEarthProject).

The repository for the backend can be found [here](https://github.com/LucaIgnatescu/FlatEarthBackend).
