- Many people believe that the earth is flat. 
- There is a good reason for this belief. 
- Primarily, personal experience (lived experience) strongly suggests that this is the case; in other words, people believe that the earth is flat, because to any observer, it looks flat. 
- Of course, we know that appearances can be deceiving [hyperlink to illusions].
- Living in a society, you are able to outsource how things actually are to other people. Most people are not astronauts or pilots, but pilots and astro....
- However, for this work smoothly, it presumes trust. 
- Unfortunately, trust in the integrity of institutions has collapsed, and it is now at a historic low [link to research]. 
- There are good reasons for this. Institutions are not immune to mission drift, ideological capture, and blatant self interest [link]. 
- We cannot solve this problem here, but what we can do is introduce a trustless method where you can check for yourself if it's possible that the earth could be flat. You're smart. You can convince youself with your own reasoning whether it's possible that the earth is flat or not. 
- Specifically, all this uses is the known distances between major world cities. You do not have to trust us that these are accurate. You can measure them yourselves. Our claim is that nobody, not even you, will be able to fit the distances between the world's cities in a planar configuration. If you can do it, we will give you a million dollars. 
- Let's see if you can do it. 



- The reason the belief sustains, is reification.
